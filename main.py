                       Pseudocode:
When game starts:
   -  Hello World! Welcome to Pixel. 

After game starts:
   -  Player spawns (you) with no resources except a basic set of tools; pickaxe to break ores; axe to gather wood; a sword to fight creatures, and a small backpack to carry your items
   
When in game: 
   - Use WASD to move and press left click to break objects

After every 20 minutes:
   - switches time of day

When it's nighttime:
   - mobs spawn

When you see mobs:
   - fight or run/seek shelter somewhere

When world loads:
   - caves also spawn with resources

When you spot a cave:
   - you can chose to enter to find and collect rare resources; beware of mobs as they'll always be in cave s no matter the time of day

An essential item you must gather:
   - a larger backpack, which you can forge in order to hold more items

To forge items:
   - you need the correct materials to make them

To make a house:
   - craft an axe out of iron, which you can find from caves so you can collect wood
     - make windows from glass

When game starts:
   - press "ESC," then click "Log Out," to sign out of the world

In certain caves:
   - there will be much larger, stronger creatures; like a mini boss fight; drops rare loot to craft magical weapons

Press "CTRL and L" to
   - display all the possible crafting recipes

Backpack crafting recipe:
   - Wool (from sheep) + a needle + scissors

Press/Hold "shift" to:
   - keep a lower profile; ex: hide from mobs

When within 8 meters of a mob:
   - they will pursue you until you either get out of their sight, or until you die to them, or kill them

When you die:
   - Game Over; you must restart your world and start fresh; no resources; says "Game Over!" on screen

Game Over:
   - you have to start a new world; square 1

When you slay an animal:
   - you can collect the meat with a knife

When eating raw meat:
   - you can easily get sick
   
To cook meat:
   - light a fire, then put meat on top of it

To make a fire:
   - gather wood, chop it down into little sticks, then use rocks (which you can find on the ground), and light it with rocks (hitting 2 rocks together automatically lights it on fire in this game)

Player dies if:
   - they don't eat food after 3 days (120 minutes; 40 mins per day)

Gather water: 
   - you automatically get one bottle of water per day; the more you move/perform activities, the more water you need to consume; find more water through rain, springs, or plants

When in game:
   - different biomes with different temperatures corresponding to each biomes

You can craft armor/better weapons by:
   - gathering the needed ores, then using an anvil, which you can craft through using a lot of iron

In order to walk faster:
   - double-tap "W" (sprint)
     
   - [Object=anything that can be manipulated]

You gain more points as you survive longer:
   - kill mobs, gather ores, etc

When you launch game:
   - You can choose between 10 skins, 5 female skins, and 5 male skins, all with varying skin tones, hair styles/color, etc

To open up your backpack to view items:
   - Press "tab," which opens up a screen that shows everything you currently have in your backpack

In game you have an HP bar:
   - You have an HP that is 4 inches across your screen

HP bar represents: 
   - Every quarter of your HP bar (1 inch) represents something;
     - When HP is 75.1/100 or more (over 3/4), HP bar will be green to represent one being in good health
       - When HP is 50.1-75%, HP bar will be orange to represent that the body is at a nuetral state; body is low on energy but can still function properly
         - When HP is 25.1-50%, HP will be yellow to represent one being either sick, lacking food, water, or were injured by a mob/creature
           - When HP is 0.1/25%, HP will be red, which signifies that one is on the brink of death 

Better weapons...:
   - More damage; kill things faster

Every mob...:
   - Has a different amount of HP (even mobs of the same kind; Ex: two zombies might have a different amount of HP, but still have around the same HP assuming both of them have the same amount of armor and are around the same age, etc)

Better armor
   - More damage can be taken  
    - Better boots; 
     - gain +12% movement speed if you have "Mythic Boots," boots that can be forged from an ore gathered from the Golem's Den
       - Golem's Den = A rare lair that can be found in caves
        - Golem = Strong creature where you can gather Mythical resources from destroying/defeating item

Running low on food/water (dehydration/malnutrition)
   - Move slower; can't perform tasks at the usual level

Barbarian's Chestplate:
   - Along with the  "Mythic Boots," you can also craft the  "Barbarian's Chestplate" with the same material
     - When equiped, you gain +12% damage, meaning every swing with a weapon does an addition 12% damage (1.12) 
       - Additionally, rather than taking 50% reduced damage, you take 65% reduced damage from attacks

Basic Armor
   - Crafted from Iron; allows you to take 50% reduced damage (excluding fall damage)

Water
   - Player also dies if they don't consume *enough* water
      - Water intake needed depends on how much work/tasks the player performs

Lava
   - There can be puddles of lava found in random places

Animals
   You can find chickens, pigs, cows, birds, boars, 

Sleep
    Press "alt+s" to make your character sleep; if your character sleeps for 10 seconds without being bothered by anything (mobs, etc), it automatically switches the time of day to daytime
